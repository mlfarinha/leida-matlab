# Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis Toolbox - Matlab

## Installation of LEiDA Toolbox

### Start by creating a new folder where all the LEiDA code and analyses will be saved. Then to install the LEiDA Toolbox unzip the folder LEiDA_Functions to the created folder and add that folder (with all its functions) to your Matlab path. In your Matlab command terminal type the following:

- addpath(genpath('my_LEiDA_directory\LEiDA_Functions'))

### If you would like to save the LEiDA_Functions folder to your Matlab path for later use:

1. click ==HOME== in your Matlab dashboard;
2. click ==Set Path==;
3. click ==Save== (making sure you see the directory my_LEiDA_directory\LEiDA_Functions in your Matlab search path pop-up window);
4. click ==Close==;


Note that the toolbox requires the Statistics and Machine Learning Matlab Toolbox.
